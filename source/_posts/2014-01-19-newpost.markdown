Title
========================================================
 
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).
 
When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
 

    summary(cars)

    ##      speed           dist    
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 43  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120

 
You can also embed plots, for example:
 

    plot(cars)

![A plot of cars](~/octopress/source/images/figure/carplot.png) 

 
Also some math:
 
$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{x_i}}{n}$
