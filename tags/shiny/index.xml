      <description>(Edited November 25, 2015.) I stand in awe of the R wizards who post their latest and greatest Shiny feats on R-Bloggers. It&amp;rsquo;s taken me a while to find my way around Shiny, but at last I feel ready to fill in a few gaps for others who may be just starting out and who aspire to write reasonably involved, user-friendly simulation apps.

      <description>Introduction This is the third in a projected five-part series of posts aimed at colleagues who teach elementary statistics. If you teach with R but hesitate to spring such a powerful and complex tool on unsuspecting introductory students—many of whom whom will have had no prior experience with the command line, much less with coding—then I hope these posts will give you some encouragement.
The previous post in this series described R Studio’s package manipulate and its applications in the easy authoring of instructional applets.</description>
