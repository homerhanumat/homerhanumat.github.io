      <description>blogdown, Yihui Xie&amp;rsquo;s new Hugo-based R-package for blogging, has begun to take off.
You can create a new site using any Hugo theme, but sometimes you must customize the theme a bit in order to enable certain expected features&amp;mdash;such as MathJax&amp;mdash;that are expected by bloggers who deal in statistics. If you are new to static-site generators then you might prefer to have someone else handle the tweaks for you so you can get to blogging right away.</description>

      <title>Hosting on your Github User Page via Submodule</title>

      <description>My primary technical blog is hosted by Github through my User repository (homerhanumat.github.io). Recently I switched my generator from Jekyll to Hugo.
From the User repository Github Pages requires that the site be served from the root of the repository (not from docs). Jekyll allowed us to build the site into the root, but Hugo builds into a specific directory, named public by default. Building into the root would look a bit messy, anyway.</description>
