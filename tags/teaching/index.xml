      <description>Introduction This is the third in a projected five-part series of posts aimed at colleagues who teach elementary statistics. If you teach with R but hesitate to spring such a powerful and complex tool on unsuspecting introductory students—many of whom whom will have had no prior experience with the command line, much less with coding—then I hope these posts will give you some encouragement.
The previous post in this series described R Studio’s package manipulate and its applications in the easy authoring of instructional applets.</description>

The first post in this series introduced package mosaic, and promised to review a supplementary package that I and a colleague put together for our own students, but I’ve decided put that off a bit and focus instead on another powerful new tool for statistics instruction: the well-known RStudio Integrated Development Environment for R, and its manipulate package in particular.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is is first in a projected five-part series of posts aimed at colleagues who teach elementary statistics.
I can’t remember exactly how I first made acquaintance with R, but it’s been an important part of my teaching/consulting life since at least 2007, when I used it for the first time in an upper-level undergraduate statistics class. As of last Fall all of our statistics classes—even the elementary ones—are based on R.</description>
