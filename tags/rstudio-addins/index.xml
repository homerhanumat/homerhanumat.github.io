      <description>There are many benefits to teaching undergraduate statistics with R&amp;ndash;especially in the RStudio environment&amp;ndash;but it must be admitted that the learning curve is fairly steep, especially when it comes to tinkering with plots to get them to look just the way one wants. If there were ever a situation when I would prefer that the students have access to a graphical user interface, production of plots would be it.
You can, of course, write Shiny apps like this one, where the user controls features of the graphs through various input-widgets.</description>
